# Report: Analysis of Prim's and Kruskal's MST Algorithms

This report presents an **empirical and theoretical analysis** of **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms for finding the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**. The analysis is based on theoretical principles from *Introduction to Algorithms* (Cormen et al., 2009) and practical results from experiments conducted on two distinct datasets: **one of 28 sparse graphs** and **one of 28 dense graphs**.

---

## 1. Summary of Input Data and Algorithm Results

### Input Data

The experiment utilized **two datasets**, each consisting of **28 connected, undirected graphs** with weighted edges. The graphs were provided in **JSON format**.

- **Sparse Dataset**: 28 graphs where the number of edges ($E$) is relatively close to the number of vertices ($V$) (e.g., $E \approx V$).
- **Dense Dataset**: 28 graphs where the number of edges ($E$) is significantly larger than the number of vertices ($V$) (e.g., $E \gg V$).

### Algorithms Implemented

Two classical **greedy algorithms** for the MST problem were implemented in **Java** and tested:

#### Prim's Algorithm

- Builds a single tree by **iteratively adding the cheapest edge** that connects a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside the MST.
- Implementation: `PrimMST.java` uses an **IndexMinPQ** (Indexed Min-Priority Queue).

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

- Builds a "forest" of trees.
- **Sorts all edges by weight** and adds edges from this list as long as they **do not form a cycle**.
- Implementation: `KruskalMST.java` uses `Collections.sort()` and a **UF (Disjoint-Set / Union-Find)** data structure.

### Summary

- **Prim's Algorithm** was consistently faster than **Kruskal's** on **both sparse and dense graphs**.
- The total execution time for **Prim's** across all datasets was **21.05 ms**, while for **Kruskal's**, it was **32.55 ms**.
- **Prim's** outperformed **Kruskal's** in **21 out of 28 cases** in terms of execution time.
- The performance difference between **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** became even more pronounced on dense graphs, where the sorting step in **Kruskal's** algorithm significantly impacted its runtime.

## 2. Comparison: Theory vs. Practice

### Theoretical Comparison *(Based on Cormen et al., 2009)*

The theoretical efficiency of both algorithms depends on the number of **vertices ($V$)** and **edges ($E$)**, as well as the **data structures used**.

---

#### Kruskal's Algorithm

- **Dominant cost**: Sorting all edges → $O(E \lg E)$
- Subsequent $E$ iterations involve $O(E)$ disjoint-set operations → with path compression and union-by-rank: $O(E \alpha(V))$
- **Total runtime**: $O(E \lg E)$ or equivalently $O(E \lg V)$

---

#### Prim's Algorithm

- Depends on the **min-priority queue** implementation:
    - **Binary min-heap (IndexMinPQ)**:
        - $V$ `EXTRACT-MIN` → $O(V \lg V)$
        - Up to $E$ `DECREASE-KEY` → $O(E \lg V)$
        - **Total**: $O(E \lg V)$
    - **Fibonacci heap**:
        - `DECREASE-KEY` → $O(1)$ amortized
        - **Total**: $O(E + V \lg V)$

---

### Practical Comparison *(Based on Test Data)*

The experimental data **perfectly aligns with the theory**.

--- 

#### Performance on Sparse Graphs ($E \approx V$)

- Both algorithms have **similar theoretical complexity**: $O(E \lg V)$ or $O(V \lg V)$
- **Practical results**:
    - **Prim's was faster in 75% of cases** (21 out of 28)
    - **Prim's total time: ~35% less** than Kruskal's (**21.05ms vs 32.55ms**)
- **Insight**: Prim's heap operations were, on average, **less costly** than Kruskal's full sort + union-find.

--- 

#### Performance on Dense Graphs ($E \gg V$)

- **Theoretical differences become dramatic** → and **practical data confirms it unequivocally**.
- **Prim's was faster in 27 out of 28 cases**
- **Prim's was 2.4x faster overall** (216ms vs 524ms)
- **Largest graph (ID #29, V=2000)**:
    - Prim's: **48.5ms**
    - Kruskal's: **162.6ms** → **3.3x slower**

> **Conclusion**: The $O(E \lg E)$ **sort bottleneck** in Kruskal’s becomes dominant as $E$ grows. Prim’s $O(E \lg V)$ scales **much more effectively**.

---

#### A Note on "Operations Count"

> **Not an apples-to-apples comparison**

| Algorithm     | What "Operations Count" Includes                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Prim's**    | Heap insertions, deletions, key changes → good proxy for $O(E \lg V)$                            |
| **Kruskal's** | $O(E)$ for sort start, $O(E)$ finds, $O(V)$ unions → **does NOT capture $O(E \lg E)$ sort cost** | 

**Explains the paradox**:

- In dense dataset: **Kruskal’s had lower op count (1.08M vs 1.11M)** but was **2.4x slower**
- **Reason**: The **most expensive part — the sort — was not counted**

---

## 3. Conclusions and Recommendations

The choice between **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** depends on **graph characteristics** and **implementation context**.

| Factor                              | Recommendation                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Graph Density**                   |                                                     |
| → **Dense Graphs ($E \gg V$)**      | **Prim's strongly preferred** — scales far better   |
| → **Sparse Graphs ($E \approx V$)** | Race is close, but **Prim's has a consistent edge** |
| **Edge Representation**             |                                                     |
| → **Edge List**                     | **Kruskal’s natural fit** (sorts edges directly)    |
| → **Adjacency List/Matrix**         | **Prim’s natural fit** (grows from root)            |
| **Implementation Complexity**       |                                                     |
| → **Kruskal’s**                     | Simpler: sort + Union-Find                          |
| → **Prim’s**                        | Requires **indexed priority queue** → more complex  |

---

### Final Recommendation

> **Prim's algorithm (with binary heap-based priority queue) is the superior choice for all-around performance.**

- **Consistent speed advantage** in sparse graphs
- **Dominant, scalable advantage** in dense graphs

> **Kruskal's algorithm** remains **simple and elegant**, but its **performance is demonstrably weaker on dense graphs** due to the **sorting bottleneck**.
